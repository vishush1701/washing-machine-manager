Django project to book the washing machine in PG
## scenario
When I was staying in pg , I used to wash clothes every week in washing machine provide in my PG . 
The problem I faced was ,there was only one single washing machine on the 4th floor terrace. In order to put my clothes I used to move to 4th floor from 1st floor where I used to stay, In odd cases which always was the machine will be occupied and never know who put the clothes in there. Some people even leave their clothes hours after the wash.
I wanted to know whether the machine is currently occupied or its in use and also used by whom so that i can inform them to take out the clothes if in case they leave the clothes out their even after the wash just throuhg a single tap in mobile.
So this django + react project will help to check the washing machine availability and book it while using so that it will help others to plan their day.

## features
* Admin can add the users and washing machines in the PG
* Users can login and see all the washing machines also currently booked by which user and will be provided option to filter based on availability and floor (to which they belong to)
* Users will be provided option to book the washing machines when using.
